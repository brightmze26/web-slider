            <h1>Doppler</h1>
            <p>The wobble method measures changes in a star's "radial velocity." The wavelength of the star's light alternately compresses and stretches as the star moves slightly closer, then slightly farther from us. This motion is caused by the gravitational pull of orbiting planets.</p>

            <h1>Astrometry</h1>
            <p>Astrometry is a technique used to detect exoplanets by precisely observing changes in a star's position relative to the surrounding stars. This method involves meticulously measuring a star's position; if the star exhibits a "wobble" (similar to the radial velocity technique) and shifts its position relative to nearby stars, it is likely that the star has a planetary system.</p>

            <h1>Transit</h1>
            <p>The transit phenomenon occurs when a smaller celestial body passes in front of a larger one from the observer's viewpoint. A transiting exoplanet is detected when it crosses in front of transits its host star, causing a dip in the star's brightness as seen from the observer's perspective. These transits repeat at intervals depending on the time it takes for the exoplanet to orbit its star.</p>

            <h1>Micro Gravity</h1>
            <p>This method observes the bending of light from a background star by the gravitational field of a foreground star. Microlensing relies on the chance alignment of two stars with an observer. When one star passes behind another, the closer star acts like a lens, bending the light and causing a gradual increase and decrease in brightness. If there is a planet around the nearer star, its gravity will also bend the light, causing an additional spike in brightness.</p>
