            <h1>WASP-103b</h1>
            <p>WASP-103b is an exoplanet discovered by the Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) project. This planet is a type of "hot Jupiter" that orbits very close to its star. The planet is about 1,500 light-years away from Earth and has an extremely close orbit to its star, taking only about 22 hours to complete one orbit. As a result, the planet is very hot and its atmosphere is evaporating, giving the planet an elliptical or oval shape.</p>

            <h1>Kepler- 1625b</h1>
            <p>Kepler-1625b is an exoplanet discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope. What is intriguing about Kepler-1625b is the indication of a potential moon orbiting it. This planet is classified as a "Gas Giant" and orbits a Sun-like star, located approximately 8,000 light-years from Earth. The most interesting feature of this planet is the candidate exomoon orbiting it, which, if confirmed, would be one of the first detected exomoons.</p>

            <h1>Superneptunus</h1>
            <p>Super-Neptune is a general term used to describe exoplanets that have a mass and size greater than Neptune but smaller than gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. Super-Neptunes have a mass between 10 to 20 times that of Earth. These planets have a composition similar to Neptune and Uranus, consisting of hydrogen, helium, water ice, and methane. They tend to have thick atmospheres and may have rocky cores.</p>
